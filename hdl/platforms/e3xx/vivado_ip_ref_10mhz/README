This core was generated in Vivado. It was used to generate a 10 MHz reference
output from the E310 FPGA, and was included in the platform worker during the
testing and verification of the E310 GPS PPS-disciplining of the
Hardware Time Service. This 10 MHz reference was initially thought to be useful
in the absence of proper test equipment, but this usefulness proved to be
limited. The core is left here, along with a snippet of the code that use to
exist in the platform worker, in case such a test is resurrected in the future.
