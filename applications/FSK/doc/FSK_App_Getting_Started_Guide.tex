\section{Overview}
The purpose of this document is to provide a compact set of instructions to build, run, and verify the OpenCPI FSK App reference application.

\section{Prerequisites}
This document assumes that the OpenCPI framework has been installed. The application is supported on all of the OpenCPI platforms, but all of the examples shown here are for the Matchstiq-Z1 platform.

\section{Build the Core Project}
If the Core Project has not been created yet, follow the instructions in the OpenCPI Getting Started Guide. Once the Core project has been created, the following ocpidev command can be used to build the primitives and workers required by the FSK app. Navigate to the Core project directory and run the command:
\begin{verbatim}
ocpidev build --rcc --rcc-platform xilinx13_3 --hdl --hdl-platform matchstiq_z1 --no-assemblies
\end{verbatim}

Note: For the Ettus E310, build for \code{xilinx13\_4} and \code{e3xx} instead of \code{xilinx13\_3} and \code{matchstiq\_z1}.\\

Note: The --no-assemblies argument excludes the creation of executable bitstreams.\\
This step takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.\\

\section{Build the Assets Project}
If the Assets Project has not been created yet, follow the instructions in the OpenCPI Getting Started Guide. Once the Assets project has been created, the following ocpidev command can be used to build the primitives and workers required by the FSK app. Navigate to the Core project directory and run the command:
\begin{verbatim}
ocpidev build --rcc --rcc-platform xilinx13_3 --hdl --hdl-platform matchstiq_z1 --hdl-assembly fsk_modem
\end{verbatim}
Note: For the Ettus E310, build for \code{xilinx13\_4} and \code{e3xx} instead of \code{xilinx13\_3} and \code{matchstiq\_z1}.\\

This step takes approximately 60 minutes to complete.

\section{Build the BSP's Project}
If the targeted platform exists in a separate BSP project, that BSP project will need to be built alongside Assets. It may be the case that certain parts of the assets project (e.g. primitives, devices, cards) should be built prior to the BSP project, but then the BSP project must be built before the assembly (which may be in Assets). For the Ettus E310, there is a BSP project that contains a copy of the FSK assemblies, so you can build it \textit{after} the assets project. Navigate to the BSP project directory and run the following command (note that in this example we use the ``e3xx'' platform because the ``matchstiq\_z1'' platform does not live in a separate project:
\begin{verbatim}
ocpidev build --rcc --rcc-platform xilinx13_4 --hdl --hdl-platform e3xx --hdl-assembly fsk_modem
\end{verbatim}
This step takes approximately 25 minutes to complete.


\section{Build the FSK Application Executable}
Next, the executable for the FSK Application must be built. Navigate to the \texttt{applications/FSK} directory of the Assets project and run the command:
\begin{verbatim}
ocpidev build --rcc-platform xilinx13_3
# Or if targeting the Ettus E310:
ocpidev build --rcc-platform xilinx13_4
\end{verbatim}
	If successful, a new directory named \textit{target-linux-x13\_3-arm} (or \textit{target-linux-x13\_4-arm} if targeting the E310) will contain the executable.

\section{Running the Application}
The following steps can also be viewed by navigating to the \texttt{applications/FSK} directory and typing \texttt{make show}. Ensure that the RX and TX ports of the platform are connected together via a coax cable. RF attenuation pads are not necessary for this test.
\subsection{Setting Up the Execution Platform}
For embedded platforms (Matchstiq-Z1, Zedboard, Ettus E310), connect to the platform via a serial port. Example syntax for establishing a connection can be seen below:
\begin{verbatim}
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
\end{verbatim}
\subsubsection{Networked Mode}
Networked Mode is one of two modes typically used for running the application. It involves creating NFS mounts between the Development Platform and the Execution Platform to enable Application deployment. A setup script is used to automate the required steps for this mode. Example syntax for running this script can be seen below:
\begin{verbatim}
source /mnt/card/opencpi/mynetsetup.sh <IP Address of Development Host>
\end{verbatim}
Note that if there is a separate project for your BSP (\textit{e.g.} in the case of the Ettus E310), you will need to update the setup script to make sure that project is NFS mounted alongside Core and Assets. This should be covered in the BSP's Getting Started Guide.
\subsubsection{Standalone Mode}
Standalone Mode is the other mode used for running the application. It involves deploying the application using files only on local storage and not over a network connection. Similar to Networked Mode, the setup for Standalone Mode also involves running a setup script. Example syntax for running this script can be seen below:
\begin{verbatim}
source /mnt/card/opencpi/mysetup.sh
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Setting OCPI\_LIBRARY\_PATH Environment Variable}
The OCPI\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable is a colon-separated list of files/directories which is searched for executable artifacts during Application Deployment. For proper execution of the FSK App, all of the FSK App artifacts (detailed in the FSK App document) must be included in the \texttt{OCPI\_LIBRARY\_PATH} environment variable. Example syntax of the setting can be seen below.
\subsubsection{Networked Mode}
In networked mode, artifact files can be accessed via NFS mounts.
\begin{verbatim}
export OCPI_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/net/cdk/../projects/core/exports/lib/components/rcc:\
/mnt/ocpi_assets/applications/FSK/../../hdl/assemblies/fsk_modem:\
/mnt/ocpi_assets/applications/FSK/../../exports/lib
\end{verbatim}
When using a platform in a separate BSP project, you may need to include that project in the OCPI\_LIBRARY\_PATH. For example, for the Ettus E310, you will need to include the BSP project in the path:
\begin{verbatim}
export OCPI_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/net/cdk/../projects/core/exports/lib/components/rcc:\
/mnt/bsp_e310/exports/lib:\
/mnt/ocpi_assets/exports/lib
\end{verbatim}
Note that for the E310, we omit the path to the \code{fsk\_modem} assembly that lives in the \textit{Assets} project because there is an updated copy of the assembly in the BSP project. Note that if your BSP project has assemblies needed for FSK app, you will need to add `hdl assemblies' to its Project.exports or point the library path to something like `\code{<bsp-project>/hdl/assemblies/}'.
\subsubsection{Standalone Mode}
In standalone mode, artifact files can be copied to the SD card.
\begin{verbatim}
export OCPI_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/card/opencpi/artifacts
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Running the Application}
To run the application, navigate to the \texttt{applications/FSK} directory and run the executable in the target-* directory of your Execution Platform. Example syntax can be seen below.
\begin{verbatim}
./target-linux-x13_3-arm/FSK txrx
# Or if targeting the Ettus E310:
./target-linux-x13_4-arm/FSK txrx
\end{verbatim}
Reference the \textit{FSK\_app.pdf} for executing the various modes (filerw, tx, rx, txrx, bbloopback) of the FSK application. Ensure that OCPI\_LIBRARY\_PATH is configured, as provided, for the respective mode and platform.
\subsection{View the Results}
After the application completes, the output can be found in the \texttt{applications/FSK/odata} directory. To view the results on the Development Host, navigate to the \texttt{applications/FSK} directory and execute the command:
\begin{verbatim}
eog odata/out_app_fsk_txrx.bin
\end{verbatim}
\end{flushleft}
\end{document}
